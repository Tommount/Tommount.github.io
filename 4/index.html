        <p>I was not happy today, I wrote my blog on paper yesterday but my parents forgot to post it on my website! It was the first time I’ve ever intermit updating my blog! I was angry when I heard this unpleasant thing this afternoon and I quickly made it up, sorry about this.</p>

        <p>It was really quite a boring day, nothing special or interesting happened, I don’t know what to write. However, today my father wrote a poem but he don’t allow me to correct some of the rhymes in it, it’s quite infuriating.</p>

       <p>Today my mother compelled me to play my clarinet and I must obey because she promised that if I do as she said this week, she will buy <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em> movie for me, which I wanted the most. I hope she will fulfill her promise this time because last time when she promised to buy the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> movie for me, she reneged her words.</p>

       <p>I was very pleased today because my mother accidentally found the Star Wars finale! I like the musics in Star Wars very much all the time, and now I can listen to it again and again! It was wonderful! I even set it to be my ringtone and alarm!</p>

       <p>It was quite a cheerful day, my mother helped me finding the music score of Star Wars and we succeeded! When I played it with my clarinet, I was so happy and excited that I almost fell to the floor. Moreover, my mother don’t have to buy <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em> movie for me because my father have already downloaded it just now!</p>

       <p>Today my father brought back a noodle-making machine, it looks quite useful and I’d like to try it out some days later.</p>
       <p>Moreover, I watched a part of <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em> movie which my father downloaded yesterday, it was engaging, fascinating, interesting and attractive, I found out that I am not able to pause the movie because it’s so wonderful! I just want to watch it on and on, but of course, it’s not allowed, I was dragged away from the computer by my father because it was quite late in the night and I must go to bed. It was really quite disappointing being dragged away at the climax of a movie.</p>

       <p>Today I made lots of noodles with the noodle-making machine I mentioned yesterday. I like the machine very much because it’s quite interesting and convenient, I made three bowls of noodle just in five minutes!And of course I ate them all, I think they are very tasty, so do my parents! All kinds of food will be tasty if you made them with hard work and with ingenuity.</p>

       <p>Today I finished watching <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring</strong></em>! It was quite a long movie, I watched it for three days! I think the movie was fantastic, there are beautiful scenes and gripping plots, it’s really a good movie, I hope you’ll enjoy it! Moreover, I will also soon be finishing reading the original book of this movie, it’s even more exciting than the movie.</p>
       <p>P.S. I can’t wait to watch the second movie of <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</em></strong> series——<em><strong>The Two Towers</em></strong>!</p>

       <p>It is said that we’ll be back to school in 20 days, it was quite a surprise to me! So, today I was planning to use the 20 days well to refresh and change myself before going back to school. I was strengthening my chemistry and physics these days and imagining the amazed faces of my classmates when they meet me again! Guys, your glegooder is back!</p>

       <p>Today I watched a video about The Top 10 Unbelievable Badminton Shots! Some of them are really unbelievable: a player's racket slips out of his hand but he quickly picked it up to continue to play and finally won the round! I was always imagining about striking the ball and let it stop on top of the net precisely these days and in the video, there was this condition,  the ball just stops in the middle and won't fall to any side! I was quite curious about how will the referee adjudge this.</p>

      <p>Today I planned the times of a day, because these days I found out that I was wasting time badly, I deeply regretted and reflected this, so I decided to formulate my times in a day. I hope I can execute my plan well and make my ambition come true this time, because my lack of perseverance and sloth.</p>
      <p> However, today it’s quite successful, I finished my homework in time!</p>

      <p>Today I watched several videos about Sir Francis Drake and his great voyages across the sea. I was learning about Sir Francis Drake in my English class and my parents liked to expand the things I’m learning in class, so they found videos about him and I really benefited a lot from them. In class and in the videos, I was told  that Drake is adventurous and courageous, he have done heroic things, but they are all avoiding the fact that Drake sold slaves and marauded ships from other countries, he was a bad pirate who captures and sells slaves! How can he be a hero? Moreover, Drake was said as an explorer, but his circumnavigate around the globe was just because of the way to get back to England was blocked by the Spanish fleet so he have to go the other way, that is to circumnavigate the globe, that’s not an epic voyage, it’s a fugitive running for his life!</p>

      <p>Today my father finally agreed to let me watch the second movie of The Lord of the Rings series—— The Two Towers! I was dreaming of watching it since I’ve watched the first one because it was so attractive, you just can’t stop watching it! It’s really enjoying to drink milk while watching a good movie, I had a wonderful time watching it! Moreover, we also made some dumplings with the noodle-making machine I mentioned before, it’s more efficient and mechanized now, you can easily make pastries out of the noodle-making machine, then you only have to press the mould on them and add the fillings! How simple!</p>

     <p>Today at lunchtime, I and my father were invited to a banquet, I was very happy because the foods are tasty and I made a friend at the table, we discussed about histories and were both pleased and impressed.</p>
     <p>After the banquet, he invited me to go and climb the Zhao Mu mountain with him, I asked my father about this and he agreed to come with us and I got into their car, soon we arrive at their home, and I can’t see my father’s car following behind, so I asked them about this but they said that my father drove home and haven’t followed their car, then they led me to the home, my friend changed clothes and we played chess for a while.</p>
     <p>Afterwards we got in the car and they drove towards the Zhao Mu mountain, on the way, we were told that there are too many visitors on the mountain, so they changed the plan and brought us to an exercising center and there was a personal coach waiting for us, we run around the playground in circles, and was very tired when we get back again. By the way, my friend’s parents were very rich they live in a big house which is unexpected to me, I was feeling restricted and unhappy and the dinner was distasteful. I was finally back at home after having dinner, it was really an unpleasant afternoon I was very upset, I went back home signing tiredly.</p>

      <p>I have nothing to write about today, I watched a bit of The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers, but it was not very interesting. However, today I wrote a piece of calligraphy, which I found quite satisfying.</p>

       <p>It was a busy night, I had lots of work to do, such as my mathematic homework and my composition homework, so I had very little time watching the movie and was again dragged away at the most exciting part. However, today I recorded my novel which I wrote on paper to the computer and made a few changes which I found quite satisfying.</p>

<h2 id="seventy-seventh"><em>seventy-seventh post</em></h2>

       <p>Today I continued to record my novel on the computer, but I have no idea how to encrypt it ,because I don’t want my parents to read my novel when I haven’t finished writing it yet. However, Just then, my mother phoned me and asked me to compress some files on the computer and send them to her, moreover, she taught me how to compress a file and I noticed an “encryption” button when I’m compressing the files! I was excited and put what I have learned into practice , soon I succeed encrypting my novel!</p>

      <p>Today I found a way of encrypting my novel on the computer without compressing it, my mother said there was a way of doing it yesterday and tried to show me but unfortunately failed. However I worked it out myself this morning! It really took me some time to find out, but the harder you try the more exciting you’ll be when you finally succeed!</p>

       <p>Today I finished watching the second movie of The Lord of the Rings series——The Two Towers, it’s also quite long but exciting.</p>
       <p> Another funny thing happened today, The sole of my shoes cracked when I went out to play with my friends, I found that out when I’m riding my bike quickly and I felt my feet are strangely cold, so I checked my shoes and found a hole at the bottom, my friends laughed for almost 5 minutes when they heard about this!</p>

      <p>Today I visited my grandparents, we haven’t seen each other for three months, because of that my grandparents were excited when they heard I am going to visit them yesterday, we received a warm welcome when we arrived at their home. After lunch, my grandfather took me to take a walk in the park near their house, The park was very beautiful in spring, there were many flowers and green grasses. The park had changed a lot, I haven’t went there for a year and now new lakes and pavilions were built, walking in these beautiful new buildings, I felt a strong poetic inspiration, now I am planning to write a poem about the wonderful scenes in the park and my feelings tomorrow.</p>
