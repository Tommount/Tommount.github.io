            <div id="fp"><p>I finished reading the book <em><strong>Ordinary World</strong></em> today, it's a very thick book, has about 120 thousand words. I am so excited that I can't believe my eyes when I saw "the end" on the last page!</p>
        <p>The book is really interesting and attractive, it tells a story of some ordinary people in China at the age of 1975~1985 struggle to live, to become rich, to pursue dreams, and to fight against destiny.</p>
        <p>There are many characters in the book, some are respectable, some are detestable, some are ridiculous...... There are friendships, there are families, but there are also lies and self-concerns......everything in the book is actual and ordinary, just like the world itself.</p>

        <p>Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans IV Caesar's Time(part 1)</strong></em>! It's the fourth book of <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
        <p>This book tells the story of Caesar from his birth to his attack to Rome. I worship Caesar very much, he is intelligent, he saw the disadvantage of the republic and he had a plan to change this; he is brave, he represented for the poor when the rich rules the republic, and he conquered Gaul undefeated!</p>
        <h3>Caesar's logion</h3>
