        <p>I finished reading the book《Ordinary World》today, it's a very thick book, has about 120 thousand words. I am so excited that I can't believe my eyes when I saw "the end" on the last page!</p>
        <p>The book is really interesting and attractive, it tells a story of some ordinary people in China at the age of 1975~1985 struggle to live, to become rich, to pursue dreams, and to fight against destiny.</p>
        <p>There are many characters in the book, some are respectable, some are detestable, some are ridiculous...... There are friendships, there are families, but there are also lies and self-concerns......everything in the book is actual and ordinary, just like the world itself.</p>
