        <p>The book is really interesting and attractive, it tells a story of some ordinary people in China at the year of 1975~1985 struggled to live, to become rich, to pursue dreams, and to fight against destiny.</p>
        <p>There are many characters in the book, some are respectable, some are detestable, some are ridiculous...... There are friendships, there are families, but there are also lies and self-concerns......everything in the book is actual and ordinary, just like the world itself.</p>

        <p>Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans IV Caesar's Time(part 1)</strong></em>! It's the fourth book of <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
        <p>This book tells the story of Caesar from his birth to his attack to Rome. I worship Caesar very much, he is intelligent; he saw the disadvantage of the republic and he had a plan to change it. he is brave; he represented the poor when the rich rule the republic, and he conquered Gaul undefeated!</p>

         <p>It takes life,</p>
        <p>It saves life.</p>
        <p>Its power can crush stone,</p>
        <p>Its clarity made things shone.</p>
        <p>It makes metal rusty.</p>
        <p>It can be large and crusty,</p>
        <p>It can be thin and fusty.</p>
        <p>It can change shape,</p>
        <p>It can change form.</p>
        <p>Cage and chains can not lock it up,</p>
        <p>It will easily escape.</p>
        <p>It summons storm.</p>
        <p>Its unpredictable when at norm.</p>

        <p>Today I finished learning <em><strong>HTML/CSS basics</em></strong> on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks to it, I am able to build webpages from HTML and CSS and JavaScript (JS) to my webpage to make it better.</p>
        <p>I am planning to make this website a website all about me, not just my blog, but also have many other webpages about my games, my pictures etc. and a home page too. of course. But that’s very hard, I can’t do that now, yet I will do that one day in the future, and when the day comes, this website will be a great and complex one.</p>

        <p>Today I found out an interesting thing in my computer, a Paint <em><strong>3D</em></strong> app!</p>
        <p>On this app, I can drew <em><strong>3D</em></strong>  and <em><strong>2D</em></strong>  shapes, and there are also some lovely stickers and cool effects, which are good and useful.</p>
        <p>After dinner, I draw a 3D picture of <em><strong>“dragon and man”</em></strong> on the app, I’m very happy with it. It is great!</p>
        <p>I am planning to use this app to make 3D games by JaveScript, maybe some month later, you’ll find my 3D game at my website on my webpage!</p>

        <p>Today I saw a video on youtube, about <a href="https://youtu.be/6Af6b_wyiwI">Bill Gates talking about Ebola and “<strong>we are not ready for the next epidemic</strong>” at TED</a>, in 2015. </p>
            <p>He listed the things that are missing:</p>
          <ol>
           <li> Surveillance and data</li>
              <li>Personnel</li>
         <li>Treatment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And he said “The fact these elements are missing is a <strong>GLOBAL FAILURE</strong>”</p>
         
           <p>He listed what we need:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Strong health systems</li>
        <li> Medical reserve crops</li>
         <li>Pair medical people with military</li>
         <li>Run germ games</li>
         <li>Research and development in areas of vaccines and diagnostics</li>
            </ol>
             <p>At the end he concluded “<strong>The Ebola epidemic can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready</strong>”</p>
         <p>It lets me think of the 2019-Con virus now spreading in China, Bill Gates was right, we are not ready, if we are better prepared, maybe the situation won’t be so serious.</p>

        <p>Today I talked with one of my father’s student Jemma (one of my friends by now), and she introduced she’s favourite video to me “Steve Jobs——How to live before you die”.</p>
        <p>I watched it later, and I think it’s really good.</p> 
        <p>Jobs talked about 3 stories in his life:</p>
   <ol>
           <li> Connecting the dots ——“you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.”</li>
           <li>Love and loss——“you’ve got to find what you love.”</li>
           <li>Death——“live each day as if it was your last.”  “don’t waste your time living someone else’s life.</li> 
       <p>He ends the speech with “Stay hungry, stay foolish.”</p>
       <p>I benefit from the video very much, especially from the “death” part, our life is short, so we must make it special, because if is ourselves, not others.</p>
       <p>And about that “Stay hungry, stay foolish”, I think I‘ve done half of it——I always want to eat, I am always staying hungry!😋</p>

       <p>I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Hobbit</em></strong> today. It is given to me by one of my father’s friends about a month ago. I am really interested in it, because I once watched the movie of this book, so I read it night and day, and it is really exciting to finally finish reading such a thick English book after a long time of hard work (as I am a Chinese)!</p>
       <p>The main story of the book is about the adventure of the Hobbit----Mr Bilbo Baggins, the thirteen dwarves, and Gandalf the wizard.</p> 
       <p>In all the characters, I think I like Bilbo the most, he is brave and clever. He saved the dwarves many times. But most importantly, he has a cool head facing the mountains of gold, and is not selfish, when the gold made Thorin the dwarf king love them so much that he refuse to share them with men and elves. Which nearly start a war.</p>
       <p>I think this shows the selfishness in our heart, we must learn to share, because sharing brings friendship and peace.</p>

   <h5>Posted on 2020/2/8</h5>
      <p> I finished reading the book <em><strong>Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles</strong></em> today!</p>
      <p>It’s not a long story, but it’s exciting. It’s a story of murder, deception and superstition with many turns. Holmes and Watson use their deduction and courage to combat a devious criminal and a horrific beast……</p>
      <p>Actually, when I was eight, I read some of Holmes’s stories, but instead of interest me, it made me afraid and became my nightmares, I dreamed about terrible murders almost every night!</p>
      <p>But now it’s much better, as I’m older, I’m not afraid of murders in the book, instead I’m interested in Holmes’s deductions and the exciting mysteries of the cases. maybe that’s also a sign of I’m more matured!</p>

      <p>I finished reading the book The Story of <em><strong>The Romans Ⅴ Caesar’s Time (Part 2)</strong></em> today! It’s the fifth book of <em><strong>The Story of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
      <p>This book continues the story of Caesar from his war with Pompey to Octavian changed Roman republic to Roman empire and became the first emperor.</p>
      <p>Rome changed into an empire is an important step. It solved all problems at once: the increase of territory; the combat between civilians and aristocrats, The poor and the rich; the powerful but inefficient senate┈</p>
      <p>I feel sorry for Caesar’s death and angry for among the group which planed the assassination of Caesar, there are his friend, there are the ones whom Caesar protected and believed, but they all betrayed him!</p>
      <p>From this book, I see that there are always conservatives trying to stop the reform of the country, they don’t accept any changes, and often go to extremes, which will cause tragedy, like the death of Caesar.</p>

      <p>We start a new term today! It's really exciting, because it's a special term!</p>
      <p>We don't learn things at school, we learn Chinese, maths, and in English by Ourselves at home. That is for our safety, because of the virus now spreading in China. If we go to school, there may be a contagion between us and that’s very dangerous! And we will receive homework every day, our teacher will announce today’s homework on WeChat and when we done it we will take a picture of our homework and send it to the teacher.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time we experienced taking every day classes without going to the school  (except some of our online interest  classes). So I feel really exciting because of the special new term!😮😀</p>

     <p>Today I went climbing rocks with my father, what a happy day it is! </p>
      <p>Many times, when we are climbing, I get myself into trouble and stuck in some hard conditions, but every time it’s my father who gets me out of them. And many times, I want to give up but my father’s encouragement always works on me that gives me confidence to go on.</p>
      <p>we went to the Ge Le mountain in the morning and its nearly lunchtime when we are back, I’m so tired but also excited, for we’ve conquered so many giant rocks, and most importantly we had some delicious chocolate on the top of the mountain when the wind blew on our face.</p>
      <p>But we must wear facemasks because of the virus, and that caused some problems. but it’s nothing compared to our epic victory! My father said that if it is not the virus, he wants to take me climbing rocks every morning!</p>

      <p>Today I read a book of some classical short stories written by Mark Twain. Among them I think I like the story <em><strong>The Million Pound Note</strong></em> the best it’s attractive, interesting and humorous. It mocks the morbidity love of money in people’s heart. </p>
      <p>This story is so classical that we even had a piece of it in our text book when I’m at grade 5. The whole class is so surprised when in the story the protagonist gets so many good food and clothes when he didn’t even payed for them! he could just show he’s Million Pound Note to a shopkeeper, and that shopkeeper will give him everything he wanted freely, and ingratiate him nervously as if he is an emperor.</p>
      <p>The title of this text is called <em><strong>the magic of money</em></strong> and I don’t think this magic will work on me because there are many things money can’t buy like friendship, family, and happiness so moneys aren’t that important to me and I also hope not to you!</p>

    <p> He didn’t show extraordinary talents like Caesar; but it’s he who ended the long civil war and brought peace to the Romans.</p>
    <p>He ruled the Roman empire for 40 years and made it go to peakedness.</p>
    <p>He is sickish, he is not good at speech and war, but he is wise, assiduous and prudent.</p> 
    <p>He finished what Caesar wished, he is a god in Romans heart.</p>
    <p>He is emperor Augustus!</p>
    <p>His story is told in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅵ Peace Under The Romans Rule</strong></em> which I finished reading today!</p>
    <p>Compare to Caesar, he is not a genius, but he is assiduous and had many helpful close friends. He let every one saw what they wanted to saw while he quietly changing Roman republic into Roman empire.</p>
    <p>We must choose our friends carefully, because some bad friends like Caesar’s killed him, but good friends like Augustus’s helped him win the wars.</p>

      <p> Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Last Book in the Universe </strong></em>!</p>
    <p> This book tells the story of the adventure of a 12-year-old boy and the last writer in the universe, an old man. They met a perfect girl who was proud but kind, and they rescued the boy’s dying sister. On the way, the old writer taught the boy a lot, so after the adventure, the boy wrote the last book in the universe.</p>
    <p> I benefit a lot from this book, I see the power of book and knowledge, I also learned that our brain mustn’t stop thinking, because in the book, they are “Brain Needles” which can pour things into your mind, almost everyone rely on it, so the needle became a drug which makes you stop thinking and let your mind sink into a dreamy joy.</p> 
    <p> We should get the knowledge our self, with our own opinion, not just accept them without thinking.</p>

       <p>Today I made an air cannon by myself!</p>                                              
       <p>I got the inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRoyalInstitution">Royal Institution</a>’s chemical experiment video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjgACB7urOo">Vortex Rings</a> on YouTube. So I excitedly prepared a bottle, a plastic bag and some string.</p>                                            
       <p>First, I cut off the bottom of the bottle.</p>                                         
       <p>Then, I covered it with my plastic bag.</p>                                            
       <p>Finally, I tied the plastic bag at the bottom with the string.</P>        
       <p>And now it’s time for fun! I used the cannon to blew smoke rings, blew water bubbles and shoot air toward paper cups.</p>

            <p> It tells the story of a thief couple's better nature asserts itself, and they protected a simple boy named Roots and his 60000 yuan from another group of thieves on the train. The two group of thieves fight both with open and secret means. In the end, the boy and the money are safe, but the thieves are all captured by the police and send to the jail.</p>
            <p>From the movie I learned that there are thieves in the world, so we mustn't let everyone around us known that we have many monies because “<em>An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth</em>”.</p>

          <p>Today I watched the movie  <em><strong>Saving Private Ryan</strong></em>！</p>
        <p>This movie shows the sensation of lost in the shadows in a normal soldier’s heart, it also shows the harm to people and countries of the callous and cruel war. </p>
        <p>The movie uses the flashback technique to tell a story of a rescue mission in the Second World War,  private Ryan’s three brothers died in the war, and himself was trapped in the enemy-occupied area, so a group of soldiers was sent to rescue him and send him back home…… </p>
        <p>My favourite character in the movie is Ryan, he has strong will、courage and sense of responsibility, he didn’t leave he’s comrades when the group found him and told him that they would took him home, instead, he asked the group to stay, and they fought together. </p>
        <p>On the way searching for Ron the group members suspected about a mission, but they had a strong leader, when some members wants to quit the mission, it’s the captain’s epic speech which made them stay and encourage them to go on. This is The power of leadership, it can make a fail change to victory. </p>
       <p>It’s really a classical movie, I wish you will enjoying it. </p>

            <p>In the short 54 years, there are four Roman emperors came and gone.</p>
            <p>Are they really that notorious?</p>
            <p>Is the time of heroes has gone far away, or the age of tyrants is coming?</p>
            <p>Are they the pusher of the empire’s perish, or are they a page in the time of a big changing?</p>
            <p>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, the four controversial emperors in the Roman history, their stories are in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅶ Notorious Emperors</strong></em>  which I finished reading today!</p>
            <p>Actually, I think Tiberius and Claudius are not so bad, it’s just Tiberius is too cold to people and Claudius is too cowardly, so people thought they are bad. This also shows that it’s not easy being an emperor.</p>
            <p>I discovered something as well——in history, many emperors who has talent in art don’t have talent in ruling an empire, like Nero who was good at music, and Li Yu in China who was good at writing poems.</p>

     <p>It’s a sad history of the empire, enemies watch for the proper moment for war, compatriots battle in a melee.</p>
     <p>The empire is going to perish, many emperors died of murder and war.</p>
     <p>In the series of ordeals, will the empire reborn or will it be ruined and lost it’s glory?</p>
     <p>This piece of history is in the book The Story of the Romans Ⅷ Crisis and Overcome which I finished reading today!</p>
     <p>From the book, I learned that “Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme”.  Vitellius tried to kill all the soldiers who swore their loyalty to the previous emperor——Otho, to prevent them from overthrowing him, but that only made his life shorter. And the emperor Vespasianus who made lows to forbid others overthrown an emperor by prosecuting him to make the emperors after him (his sons) safer, but that led to the assassination of Domitianus, because there is no other ways of getting rid of him.</p>
