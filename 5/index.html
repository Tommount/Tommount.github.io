      <p>I was very busy these days, my mum was always calling:"Tom! your.....homework wasn't done yet!" it made me felt anxious and unhappy, beacause I was always thinking about how many work I still have to do, which made me frustrated. Moreover, I have no time to write my novel and watch movies, my timetable was also disorganized! What a disaster!</p>

      <p>Today I finally did all the things which my mother urged me to do again and again these days! However, because of this, I had very little time watching the movie and playing with my friends, but I might be happier tomorrow because all the works are done! Just like the old saying says: “sweet comes after bitter”!</p>

      <p>Today I watched a video broadcasted by BBC about “Du Fu, the greatest poet in China history”! I liked to watch videos about China’s history from the point of view of foreigners all the time, this time also but it was more interesting than the other videos because there are the poems of Du Fu translated to English and read in the tone of Shakespeare’s plays! I think the translation is quite good and had a special charm. I have read lots of Chinese poems written by Du Fu, I know his style very well and I can still feel it in the English translation, his worry about the fall of the dynasty, his compassion on the poor and his indignation of the wickedness. All these characteristics are respectable and honorable.</p>

      <p>Today I found a way of encrypting my novel on the computer without compressing it, my mother said there was a way of doing it yesterday and tried to show me but unfortunately failed. However I worked it out myself this morning! It really took me some time to find out, but the harder you try the more exciting you’ll be when you finally succeed!</p>

      <p>I was busy today, I have an English lesson at 8 o’clock and after the lesson I must watch a 20 minute physic video on Khan Academy, I think the video was too slow so I doubled the speed. However, my father thought I am speeding up the video to muddle through and watch the movie, he was furious but I explained why, he still suspects me and paused the video many times to check that I was listening and thinking, I answered his questions correctly every time so that he must admit  I’m not trying to muddle him and let me watch the movie.</p>

      <p>Today I rode bike with my friend and went back home very late,  I had a wonderful time riding bike with him. We rode around the playground and we even explored the garage,  the garage was quite deep and very scary,  but the slopes they're all really exciting,  I haven't been this happy for a long time!</p>

     <p>Many things happened today ，let me tell you one by one. </p>
      <p>Firstly ，I felt sick and tired， I took some medicine but didn't feel any better ，my parents were worried.</p>
      <p>Secondly, today I finished watching the whole series of the lord of the rings movie. The movie is about friendship, courage resisting the allure of power and overcoming the hopelessness.From the movie, I  learnt that a kind,  brave, wise person with a helpful friend will always succeed.</p>
      <p>Moreover , today, I tried to cut hair for my grandfather, however I failed. Fortunately ,my father stopped me just in time ,so that I haven't done to much damage to the hair.</p>

      <p>Today I was supposed to be at school but because I didn’t feel very well these days, my mother asked for leave for me, so I stayed at home. It was quite boring at home, many works have to be done and I can’t go out to play, because my friends all have to go to school, it wasn’t as good as I thought.</p>

      <p>I was very busy today there’s a large amount of homework from school and from my parents, because of the virus we spent most of the time in this term learning on the Internet, so now my teachers are leaving homeworks madly, it really drove me mad!</p>

      <p>Today things are getting worse, I have to do two tests in one day, it’s really infuriating and frustrating! I start to pity my friends and classmates who were confined to school now, it is said that they can’t even talk with each other and have to do more work than me! Oh goodness! It’s all because of the evil virus, I hope everything will get back to normal soon.</p>

       <p>Today I was also very busy but I saw hope ahead —— The May Day holiday! Tomorrow everything will get better I will go to my grandparents and have lunch with them, after that, we are going to take a walk and a nearby park, how wonderful! Moreover, my mother brought back the whole series of <em><strong>The Legend of the Condor Heroes</strong></em> novel! I was excited! It is said that the novel was very attractive, I can’t wait to read it!</p>

       <p>It was a happy day, I visited my grandparents and we rowed boats on the lake in the park! We took pictures of birds and fishes on the lake, it was a wonderful time! Moreover, today my mother brought back the third book of the Galactic Empire series: Second Foundation by Isaac Asimov! It was the best science fiction novel series I’ve ever seen!</p>

       <p>Today I played badminton for more than three hours, I went out at 5 PM and didn’t get back home until 8:30! Then My parents and I drove to the supermarket for shopping and we bought some pasta, biscuits and most importantly, a box of ice cream! We are planning to eat pasta for breakfast tomorrow and have some biscuits for tea, it’s really exciting and satisfying!</p>

       <p>I wasted a lot of time today, it caused me to go to bed very late, I was very tired. By the way, the ice cream is very delicious, I ate some this afternoon.</p>

       <p>At last, strong wind after so many hot days!  As spring grew into summer, the weather got hotter and  hotter,  I started to eat ice cream and wear T-shirts. However, today was unnaturally cold and windy,  I can't even play badminton with my friends,  but the cooler, the better,  because it was really hot these days. </p>

       <p>Today I have finally finished all the work I have to do but the May Day holiday was coming to an end too. I went out to play with my friends quite early today and when I came home I watched TV which I wanted to do for a long time! Tomorrow will be my first day at school I am excited and worried I hope it won’t be too boring.</p>

       <p>Today I finally returned to school after separating for four months,  it was really a pleasure to talk with my old friends and classmates after the long holiday! Going back to school wasn't as bad as I thought, we can talk freely and the school lunch was much better! I am thinking about my happy times at school now, instead of imagining how bad it'll be.</p>

       <p>As days grew longer and longer, the weather became hotter and hotter, because of this, the nasty mosquitoes were stinging me again! I reported this to my parents and as I’m writing my blog here, my parents are preparing mosquito nets in the bedroom, I hope it will be a peaceful night without the unwelcome mosquitoes.</p>
