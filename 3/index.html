     <p>I watched lots of videos about sending astronauts to Mars these days, it’s an attractive idea to me because of the mysteries and imaginations about Mars. There are many science fiction books about aliens from Mars and their invasion to Earth.</p>
     <p>As I’m a science fiction fan, I really want to find out whether there are or there were life on Mars. But landing, walking or living on Mars is really different from the moon or the Earth, it’s very difficult, many problems need to be solved and solving them is our mission, because we are the younger generation, we are the future of humanity. Maybe the dream of sending humans to Mars can come true with our hard work when we grow up!</p>

     <p>There are so many coincidences these days, I was learning cosmology and astronomy on Khan Academy and found videos on the internet and TV programs about the universe the planets and galaxies, and today I watched another live lecture of a scientist in Beijing university, about the solar system. I was not only enthusiastic about the idea that there are many “solar system”s just like ours in the universe (the idea was told in the lecture), but also curious about life on other planets.</p>
     <p>The universe is expanding just like our enriching  knowledge we can never explore the universe completely just like we can’t learn all the knowledges. But the process of exploring, discovering and learning it self is a kind of enjoyment.</p>

     <p>Today the big playground of the university I’m living in finally lifted the ban! At last! After two months I can run and jump and play basketball with my friends freely! But the virus is still spreading  though it’s more controlled now, we still have to wear facemasks when we are playing. It’s so exciting to play like that after staying at home for a long time!</p>

    <p>Today I finished writing the second chapter of my science fiction novel! In fact it took me almost a year to write it because I have very little time doing things I like, such as writing my novel. Writing this novel actually made me become more interested in biology, astronomy and cosmology, because even it’s science fiction, it still needs science behind it. I will keep writing my novel and hopefully somedays later you’ll find on my blog I’ve finished writing it!</p>

     <p>It’s a wonderful day today! I played table tennis, badminton and basketball with my friends. Actually, I was planning to play table tennis with one of my friends yesterday but unfortunately when we went out together it was too dark in the night, so we gave up and decided to play together today. </p>
     <p>This time we went out early in the evening and played table tennis for an hour, then, when it’s getting dark, we went to the playground to play badminton and met another friend there. So we played basketball for a long time before we  went home happily.</p>

<p>My interest in Germany is growing these days because of the bedtime story told by my dad. He is an economy teacher, and always tells stories of the rise and fall of empires and their economic policies. Today he found an exciting video about the unity and quick-rising economy of Germany, it’s really wonderful. I hope similar to Germany, China can also rise up faster and become a world-leading country!</p>

      <p>Today I wrote a poem about time because we learned the text Transient Days wrote by Zhu Zi Qing and I’ve watched some videos and lectures about space and time these days. I think the poem is quite good, maybe I’ll translate it to English tomorrow and you will see it on my blog!</p>

    <p><br>Time!</br>

<p>I found a movie called <strong><em>The King’s Choice</em></strong> today! I think it’s quite a good movie, it tells the story of The Norway’s king’s stand in the Second World War, but unfortunately I’ve just watched a bit of it when my father came into the room and forbid me to watch movies this week because I’ve watched one yesterday, it was really frustrating! However, I will finish watching it some days later and you may see it on my blog!</p>

   <p>I played four hours with my friends this afternoon! It’s really exciting and wonderful, we played badminton and football.</p>
   <p>We also played hide and seek, it’s quite thrilling, there are many times when we are about to get in an elevator the “cat”(seeker) came by, you can actually feel the blood coming up into your brain at the moment, we’re desperate to close the doors before the “cat” came in, it’s an unforgettable moment.</p>
   <p>However, it’s quite a happy time playing badminton because I achieved 14 consecutive win record today!</p>

     <p>Today I watched a video about how to write a good book. I think it’s quite helpful to me because I’m writing my science fiction novel right now but I’m not sure whether I am able to follow the instructions in the video, because of my lack of perseverance and I have very little time writing it. However, I’ll try to do my best and hopefully when I finished writing my novel it’ll be a good and popular one!</p>

     <p>What a busy and happy day! Today I had a math lesson and an English lesson, that’s why it’s a busy day, but today I also found some interesting videos about the 4-D shapes, I Was amazed and curious. It’s hard to imagine the world of high dimensionalities but is also exciting to imagine. I was also absorbed by the beautiful and complex 3-D shapes which 4-D shapes can cast in our 3-D world, I found the beauty of math and geometry!</p>

       <p>Today my father told me the stories of the rise and fall of Russia’s economy and Putin’s reformation. Actually, I didn’t feel very well today, I feel a bit dizzy and had a fever today and this also quite a boring day so excuse me for not writing very much in today’s post.</p>

     <p>Today I read an article about the America’s economy development. From the article I found out that countries would do anything: war, tricks, even lies to gain profit. I also saw that it’s not easy being a president or the leader of a country because they have to have good strategy layouts, they have to be wise and most importantly, they also have to be a half scientist, half economist and half strategist.</p>
     <p>Like my father said, “Statesmen are careful with every word they say and their words usually don’t just have one meaning, you should never just comprehend their words literally.” it’s obviously hard to do that all the time but “with great power, comes great responsibility”, if you want the power, you have to undertake the responsibility first.</p>

       <p>Today I watched two interesting videos, one is about how economy machine works, the other is about the top five powerful families who run the world. The first video let me know more deeply about economy and why there are depressions, it also made me understand how stock market and credits work which troubled me long since. However, the second video is more exciting than the first one, it tells the story of the five richest and most powerful families in the world, sadly the speech-speed of this video is too fast, I can’t catch up with it very well. Anyway, it was a happy day and I enjoyed the videos.</p>

     <p>I haven’t seen my mom for a long time, today she finally came back! I was excited and pleased, it’s wonderful! We talked a lot, she asked me about my learning and we discussed some of the books my mother liked.</p>
     <p>When I went out to play with my friends this afternoon, I found out that they all came with their mother but mine isn’t back yet, I was quite disappointed but when I came home, my mother was back! It was a big surprise!</p>

      <p>I like to drink yogurt all the time. However, because of the virus, I haven’t drunk it for many weeks, today I finally get a bottle of yogurt! I plead my parents many times and today they finally agreed to buy some yogurt for me! I was very happy because I wanted to drink it for a long time. It’s a wonderful feeling to obtain my heart’s desire after a long wait.</p>

      <p>Today my mother promised that she will buy one of the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> movies for me this Sunday! She agreed to buy it to celebrate the sixtieth post of my blog, she said that 60 days will let me get into a good habit, so it’ll be an important day. Of course, I’ll continue to update my blog every day and my ambition is to reach 1000 posts!</p>

       <p>It was a windy and rainy day, the air was chilly, The grasses were green and flowers were blooming. I was touched by this scene, so I took out my pen and wrote a Chinese poem about this wonderful sight. I think it was a good poem but sadly I can’t translate the rhymes, so I wont posted on my blog.</p>
       <p>However, because it’s a windy day, when I went out to play badminton with my friends, we are not able to play it normally. When I am at the tailwind side, The ball will always fly too far and my opponent can’t even strike the ball! It’s quite a fun playing it in a windy weather!</p>
