            <p>Today I watched the Chinese movie <em><strong>A World Without Thieves</strong></em>!</p>
            <p> It tells the story of a thief couple's better nature asserts itself, and they protected a simple boy named Roots and his 60000 yuan from another group of thieves on the train. The two group of thieves fight both with open and secret means. In the end, the boy and the money are safe, but the thieves are all captured by the police and send to the jail.</p>
            <p>From the movie I learned that there are thieves in the world, so we mustn't let everyone around us known that we have many monies because “<em>An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth</em>”.</p>

          <p>Today I watched the movie  <em><strong>Saving Private Ryan</strong></em>！</p>
        <p>This movie shows the sensation of lost in the shadows in a normal soldier’s heart, it also shows the harm to people and countries of the callous and cruel war. </p>
        <p>The movie uses the flashback technique to tell a story of a rescue mission in the Second World War,  private Ryan’s three brothers died in the war, and himself was trapped in the enemy-occupied area, so a group of soldiers was sent to rescue him and send him back home…… </p>
        <p>My favourite character in the movie is Ryan, he has strong will、courage and sense of responsibility, he didn’t leave he’s comrades when the group found him and told him that they would took him home, instead, he asked the group to stay, and they fought together. </p>
        <p>On the way searching for Ron the group members suspected about a mission, but they had a strong leader, when some members wants to quit the mission, it’s the captain’s epic speech which made them stay and encourage them to go on. This is The power of leadership, it can make a fail change to victory. </p>
       <p>It’s really a classical movie, I wish you will enjoying it. </p>

            <p>In the short 54 years, there are four Roman emperors came and gone.</p>
            <p>Are they really that notorious?</p>
            <p>Is the time of heroes has gone far away, or the age of tyrants is coming?</p>
            <p>Are they the pusher of the empire’s perish, or are they a page in the time of a big changing?</p>
            <p>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, the four controversial emperors in the Roman history, their stories are in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅶ Notorious Emperors</strong></em>  which I finished reading today!</p>
            <p>Actually, I think Tiberius and Claudius are not so bad, it’s just Tiberius is too cold to people and Claudius is too cowardly, so people thought they are bad. This also shows that it’s not easy being an emperor.</p>
            <p>I discovered something as well——in history, many emperors who has talent in art don’t have talent in ruling an empire, like Nero who was good at music, and Li Yu in China who was good at writing poems.</p>

    <p>I was furious today， because I planned today’s blog to be a text about the argue between my father and my grandmother, but they both forbid me to post it on my website even I had written it down, it really made me angry. Because it’s the only interesting or important thing happened today, if I can’t post it I can’t think of anything else to write about! So in the end I decided just to write about this thing itself.</p>

      <p>Today I found out an interesting thing.</p>
      <p>I was playing around on YouTube when I discovered a “360° Video” part I was very curious about it, so I secretly watched one of the videos and found it really wonderful and magical!</p>
      <p>It’s like watching a VR movie! You can see things in all directions by dragging on the screen, and fortunately, I also found out that my father had downloaded some videos on the computer they really glut my eyes!</p>

     <p>It’s a sad history of the empire, enemies watch for the proper moment for war, compatriots battle in a melee.</p>
     <p>The empire is going to perish, many emperors died of murder and war.</p>
     <p>In the series of ordeals, will the empire reborn or will it be ruined and lost it’s glory?</p>
     <p>This piece of history is in the book The Story of the Romans Ⅷ Crisis and Overcome which I finished reading today!</p>
     <p>From the book, I learned that “Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme”.  Vitellius tried to kill all the soldiers who swore their loyalty to the previous emperor——Otho, to prevent them from overthrowing him, but that only made his life shorter. And the emperor Vespasianus who made lows to forbid others overthrown an emperor by prosecuting him to make the emperors after him (his sons) safer, but that led to the assassination of Domitianus, because there is no other ways of getting rid of him.</p>

     <p>Today I read the short story <strong><em>The Two Fishermen</em></strong> written by Maupassant.</p>
     <p>It tells the story of two fishermen friends went fishing when their city is besieged by enemies in a war, they have the password in their army, and they are very careful, but they are still caught by the enemy.</p>
     <p>From the story, I learned that we mustn’t take unnecessary risks, like the two fishermen, but I also see courage and loyalty in their hearts, because they didn’t tell the passwords to the enemy, which made them die in the end.</p>

     <p>Today I watched a video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1jn86eUX0E"><strong><em>A Tale of Five Senses</em></strong></a>.</P>
     <p>the video caused me to rethink deeply about the world around us, because it is proved that our basic senses, our elementary ways to explore the world can mislead us, so are the world just a mislead or a “delicate fiction”? If it is, what is the real world like? If it isn’t, how can we prove it?</P>
     <p>But of course, these questions have no answers, though I will still be glad to hear your thoughts!</P>

    <p>I tested my vocabulary today!</p> 
    <p>I was really excited to see my reading vocabulary reached 6000 and my listening vocabulary reached 7000!</p>
    <p>I was worried before the test, but unfortunately the worry comes true. When I’m testing my listening vocabulary, the phone suddenly stuck in a page and won’t let me go on testing when I’m almost finished! So I have to test again, but "<em>a loss may turn out to be a gain, misfortune may be an actual luck</em>"，maybe I’ve done worse in the unfinished one than the one I finished!  Who knows!</p>

   <p>Today I thought about an interesting question, water is important to us, we can't live without them, but gold is more expensive than water, even we can't eat or drink it!</p>
   <h3><strong><em>But WHY is it❓❓❓</em></strong></h3>
   <p>Is it just because of the gold is rare, or in some conditions water can be more expensive than gold? There are many hypothesis of mine, but I'd like to hear your thoughts!</p>

    <p>Today I read an article about the difference between pieces knowledge and a knowledge system, knowledges is only useful to us when we put them together and we line them up in a system, learning pieces of knowledge is just a waste of time. Like I know a piece of knowledge in physic and I also know a piece of knowledge in biology or in chemistry but they are just tiny pieces, learning these pieces can’t make me become a physicist or a chemist. And like which superstar like what colors, these are also knowledges but learning them is a waste of time, they have no use to me!</p>
    <p>“Knowledge is power”, this sentence is actually not very correct, it should be “Systems of knowledge is power”. Many knowledges on the Internet nowadays have been ripped apart, they are pieces, they can only make you win a quick quiz but they can’t let you pass a real exam.</p>
    <p>So we must choose what things do we learn carefully, because our time is limited, we mustn’t waste them.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it’s the longest English composition I’ve ever wrote, it has about 540 words! I was excited, my dad sent my composition to many of his friends who is good at English writing and asked them to give some advise. I can’t share my composition on WeChat like my dad, but I can share it on my website with you!</p>

    <p>I’m learning about chemistry and  astronomy these days and today I thought about a question of how can the protons in the nucleus bond together so tightly? It is widely known that protons are positive electrically charged and electrons are negative electrically charged so they attract each other, but how can the two or more same positive charged protons bonded so tightly together in the nucleus? There must be another more powerful force acting between them. But what force can be stronger than electromagnetic force? I and my farther discussed about this but we can’t work that out, and I didn’t find any good answers on the Internet so if you have any idea, please let me know.</p>

    <p>Today I had a table tennis ball competition with my dad, he won in the end even though l also beat him in some rounds. It really made me feel that my techniques in table tennis needs to be improved. Every time when I strike, the ball will fly too far which made me timid and didn’t dare to strike when there is a chance.</p>
    <p>I am also moving too slow, this really made me lost many scores. I think these are my main problems at table tennis. I will fix them as soon as I can and of course, I’ll keep learning and keep practicing table tennis, maybe some time in the future, I will be able to defeat my dad!</p>

     <p>Today my dad told me about the Zhenbao Island incident. I was excited and interested because I like histories, wars and politics between countries all the time.</p>
     <p>We discussed about the incident and searched it on the Internet, we saw different opinions of the incident from the perspective of different countries. China thought the incident was a self-defense counterattack but Russia thought it’s us who cunningly attacked them first, America on the other hand, thought this incident made it gain profit while it just looks on the battle.</p>
     <p>All in all, I think I can learn a lot from the game between countries and especially powerful and big countries. Because between these countries, every step of action is done with lots of schemes in it, and these schemes are really interesting to consider about.</p>
