   <div id="fp"><p>I finished reading the book <em><strong>Ordinary World</strong></em> today, it's a very thick book, has about 120 thousand words. I am so excited that I can't believe my eyes when I saw "the end" on the last page!</p>
        <p>The book is really interesting and attractive, it tells a story of some ordinary people in China at the year of 1975~1985 struggled to live, to become rich, to pursue dreams, and to fight against destiny.</p>
        <p>There are many characters in the book, some are respectable, some are detestable, some are ridiculous...... There are friendships, there are families, but there are also lies and self-concerns......everything in the book is actual and ordinary, just like the world itself.</p>

        <p>Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans IV Caesar's Time(part 1)</strong></em>! It's the fourth book of <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
        <p>This book tells the story of Caesar from his birth to his attack to Rome. I worship Caesar very much, he is intelligent; he saw the disadvantage of the republic and he had a plan to change it. he is brave; he represented the poor when the rich rule the republic, and he conquered Gaul undefeated!</p>

        <p>Today I write a poem, I want to share it with you.</p>
        <h3><em><strong>WATER</strong></em> </h3>
         <span id="poem">
         <p>It takes life,</p>
        <p>It saves life.</p>
        <p>Its power can crush stone,</p>
        <p>Its clarity made things shone.</p>
        <p>It makes metal rusty.</p>
        <p>It can be large and crusty,</p>
        <p>It can be thin and fusty.</p>
        <p>It can change shape,</p>
        <p>It can change form.</p>
        <p>Cage and chains can not lock it up,</p>
        <p>It will easily escape.</p>
        <p>It summons storm.</p>
        <p>Its unpredictable when at norm.</p>
        <p>Its in the lake,</p>
        <p>Its in the river,</p>
        <p>Its water, Its everywhere! </p>

        <p>Today I finished learning <em><strong>HTML/CSS basics</em></strong> on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks to it, I am able to build webpages from HTML and CSS and JavaScript (JS) to my webpage to make it better.</p>
        <p>I am planning to make this website a website all about me, not just my blog, but also have many other webpages about my games, my pictures etc. and a home page too. of course. But that’s very hard, I can’t do that now, yet I will do that one day in the future, and when the day comes, this website will be a great and complex one.</p>

        <p>Today I found out an interesting thing in my computer, a Paint <em><strong>3D</em></strong> app!</p>
        <p>On this app, I can drew <em><strong>3D</em></strong>  and <em><strong>2D</em></strong>  shapes, and there are also some lovely stickers and cool effects, which are good and useful.</p>
        <p>After dinner, I draw a 3D picture of <em><strong>“dragon and man”</em></strong> on the app, I’m very happy with it. It is great!</p>
        <p>I am planning to use this app to make 3D games by JaveScript, maybe some month later, you’ll find my 3D game at my website on my webpage!</p>

        <p>Today I saw a video about <a href="https://youtu.be/6Af6b_wyiwI">Bill Gates talking about Ebola and “<strong>we are not ready for the next epidemic</strong>” at TED</a>, in 2015. </p>
            <p>He listed the things that are missing:</p>
          <ol>
           <li> Surveillance and data</li>
              <li>Personnel</li>
         <li>Treatment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And he said “The fact these elements are missing is a <strong>GLOBAL FAILURE</strong>”</p>
         
           <p>He listed what we need:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Strong health systems</li>
        <li> Medical reserve crops</li>
         <li>Pair medical people with military</li>
         <li>Run germ games</li>
         <li>Research and development in areas of vaccines and diagnostics</li>
            </ol>
             <p>At the end he concluded “<strong>The Ebola epidemic can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready</strong>”</p>
         <p>It lets me think of the 2019-Con virus now spreading in China, Bill Gates was right, we are not ready, if we are better prepared, maybe the situation won’t be so serious.</p>

        <p>Today I talked with one of my father’s student Jemma (one of my friends by now), and she introduced she’s favourite video to me “Steve Jobs——How to live before you die”.</p>
        <p>I watched it later, and I think it’s really good.</p> 
        <p>Jobs talked about 3 stories in his life:</p>
   <ol>
           <li> Connecting the dots ——“you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.”</li>
           <li>Love and loss——“you’ve got to find what you love.”</li>
           <li>Death——“live each day as if it was your last.”  “don’t waste your time living someone else’s life.</li> 
       <p>He ends the speech with “Stay hungry, stay foolish.”</p>
       <p>I benefit from the video very much, especially from the “death” part, our life is short, so we must make it special, because if is ourselves, not others.</p>
       <p>And about that “Stay hungry, stay foolish”, I think I‘ve done half of it——I always want to eat, I am always staying hungry!😋</p>

       <p>I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Hobbit</em></strong> today. It is given to me by one of my father’s friends about a month ago. I am really interested in it, because I once watched the movie of this book, so I read it night and day, and it is really exciting to finally finish reading such a thick English book after a long time of hard work (as I am a Chinese)!</p>
       <p>The main story of the book is about the adventure of the Hobbit----Mr Bilbo Baggins, the thirteen dwarves, and Gandalf the wizard.</p> 
       <p>In all the characters, I think I like Bilbo the most, he is brave and clever. He saved the dwarves many times. But most importantly, he has a cool head facing the mountains of gold, and is not selfish, when the gold made Thorin the dwarf king love them so much that he refuse to share them with men and elves. Which nearly start a war.</p>
       <p>I think this shows the selfishness in our heart, we must learn to share, because sharing brings friendship and peace.</p>

      <p> I finished reading the book <em><strong>Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles</strong></em> today!</p>
      <p>It’s not a long story, but it’s exciting. It’s a story of murder, deception and superstition with many turns. Holmes and Watson use their deduction and courage to combat a devious criminal and a horrific beast……</p>
      <p>Actually, when I was eight, I read some of Holmes’s stories, but instead of interest me, it made me afraid and became my nightmares, I dreamed about terrible murders almost every night!</p>
      <p>But now it’s much better, as I’m older, I’m not afraid of murders in the book, instead I’m interested in Holmes’s deductions and the exciting mysteries of the cases. maybe that’s also a sign of I’m more matured!</p>

      <p>I finished reading the book The Story of <em><strong>The Romans Ⅴ Caesar’s Time (Part 2)</strong></em> today! It’s the fifth book of <em><strong>The Story of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
      <p>This book continues the story of Caesar from his war with Pompey to Octavian changed Roman republic to Roman empire and became the first emperor.</p>
      <p>Rome changed into an empire is an important step. It solved all problems at once: the increase of territory; the combat between civilians and aristocrats, The poor and the rich; the powerful but inefficient senate┈</p>
      <p>I feel sorry for Caesar’s death and angry for among the group which planed the assassination of Caesar, there are his friend, there are the ones whom Caesar protected and believed, but they all betrayed him!</p>
      <p>From this book, I see that there are always conservatives trying to stop the reform of the country, they don’t accept any changes, and often go to extremes, which will cause tragedy, like the death of Caesar.</p>

      <p>We start a new term today! It's really exciting, because it's a special term!</p>
      <p>We don't learn things at school, we learn Chinese, maths, and in English by Ourselves at home. That is for our safety, because of the virus now spreading in China. If we go to school, there may be a contagion between us and that’s very dangerous! And we will receive homework every day, our teacher will announce today’s homework on WeChat and when we done it we will take a picture of our homework and send it to the teacher.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time we experienced taking every day classes without going to the school  (except some of our online interest  classes). So I feel really exciting because of the special new term!😮😀</p>

     <p>Today I went climbing rocks with my father, what a happy day it is! </p>
      <p>Many times, when we are climbing, I get myself into trouble and stuck in some hard conditions, but every time it’s my father who gets me out of them. And many times, I want to give up but my father’s encouragement always works on me that gives me confidence to go on.</p>
      <p>we went to the Ge Le mountain in the morning and its nearly lunchtime when we are back, I’m so tired but also excited, for we’ve conquered so many giant rocks, and most importantly we had some delicious chocolate on the top of the mountain when the wind blew on our face.</p>
      <p>But we must wear facemasks because of the virus, and that caused some problems. but it’s nothing compared to our epic victory! My father said that if it is not the virus, he wants to take me climbing rocks every morning!</p>

      <p>Today I read a book of some classical short stories written by Mark Twain. Among them I think I like the story <em><strong>The Million Pound Note</strong></em> the best it’s attractive, interesting and humorous. It mocks the morbidity love of money in people’s heart. </p>
      <p>This story is so classical that we even had a piece of it in our text book when I’m at grade 5. The whole class is so surprised when in the story the protagonist gets so many good food and clothes when he didn’t even payed for them! he could just show he’s Million Pound Note to a shopkeeper, and that shopkeeper will give him everything he wanted freely, and ingratiate him nervously as if he is an emperor.</p>
      <p>The title of this text is called <em><strong>the magic of money</em></strong> and I don’t think this magic will work on me because there are many things money can’t buy like friendship, family, and happiness so moneys aren’t that important to me and I also hope not to you!</p>

    <p> He didn’t show extraordinary talents like Caesar; but it’s he who ended the long civil war and brought peace to the Romans.</p>
    <p>He ruled the Roman empire for 40 years and made it go to peakedness.</p>
    <p>He is sickish, he is not good at speech and war, but he is wise, assiduous and prudent.</p> 
    <p>He finished what Caesar wished, he is a god in Romans heart.</p>
    <p>He is emperor Augustus!</p>
    <p>His story is told in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅵ Peace Under The Romans Rule</strong></em> which I finished reading today!</p>
    <p>Compare to Caesar, he is not a genius, but he is assiduous and had many helpful close friends. He let every one saw what they wanted to saw while he quietly changing Roman republic into Roman empire.</p>
    <p>We must choose our friends carefully, because some bad friends like Caesar’s killed him, but good friends like Augustus’s helped him win the wars.</p>

    <p>He thinks I’m not modest enough and don’t accept his words, but I think I can have my own opinion and his attitude was too fierce. Then he announced that he won’t give me advice and help next time if I ask for him so I went away angrily.</p>

      <p> Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Last Book in the Universe </strong></em>!</p>
    <p> This book tells the story of the adventure of a 12-year-old boy and the last writer in the universe, an old man. They met a perfect girl who was proud but kind, and they rescued the boy’s dying sister. On the way, the old writer taught the boy a lot, so after the adventure, the boy wrote the last book in the universe.</p>
    <p> I benefit a lot from this book, I see the power of book and knowledge, I also learned that our brain mustn’t stop thinking, because in the book, they are “Brain Needles” which can pour things into your mind, almost everyone rely on it, so the needle became a drug which makes you stop thinking and let your mind sink into a dreamy joy.</p> 
    <p> We should get the knowledge our self, with our own opinion, not just accept them without thinking.</p>

       <p>Today I made an air cannon by myself!</p>                                              
       <p>I got the inspiration from the <a href="https://www.rigb.org">Royal Institution</a>’s chemical experiment video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjgACB7urOo">Vortex Rings</a>. So I excitedly prepared a bottle, a plastic bag and some string.</p>                                            
       <p>First, I cut off the bottom of the bottle.</p>                                         
       <p>Then, I covered it with my plastic bag.</p>                                            
       <p>Finally, I tied the plastic bag at the bottom with the string.</P>        
       <p>And now it’s time for fun! I used the cannon to blew smoke rings, blew water bubbles and shoot air toward paper cups.</p>

The two group of thieves fight both with open and secret means. In the end, the boy and the money are safe, but the thieves are all captured by the police and send to the jail.</p>
            <p>From the movie I learned that there are thieves in the world, so we mustn't let everyone around us known that we have many monies because “<em>An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth</em>”.</p>

          <p>Today I watched the movie  <em><strong>Saving Private Ryan</strong></em>！</p>
        <p>This movie shows the sensation of lost in the shadows in a normal soldier’s heart, it also shows the harm to people and countries of the callous and cruel war. </p>
        <p>The movie uses the flashback technique to tell a story of a rescue mission in the Second World War,  private Ryan’s three brothers died in the war, and himself was trapped in the enemy-occupied area, so a group of soldiers was sent to rescue him and send him back home…… </p>
        <p>My favourite character in the movie is Ryan, he has strong will、courage and sense of responsibility, he didn’t leave he’s comrades when the group found him and told him that they would took him home, instead, he asked the group to stay, and they fought together. </p>
        <p>On the way searching for Ron the group members suspected about a mission, but they had a strong leader, when some members wants to quit the mission, it’s the captain’s epic speech which made them stay and encourage them to go on. This is The power of leadership, it can make a fail change to victory. </p>
       <p>It’s really a classical movie, I wish you will enjoying it. </p>

            <p>In the short 54 years, there are four Roman emperors came and gone.</p>
            <p>Are they really that notorious?</p>
            <p>Is the time of heroes has gone far away, or the age of tyrants is coming?</p>
            <p>Are they the pusher of the empire’s perish, or are they a page in the time of a big changing?</p>
            <p>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, the four controversial emperors in the Roman history, their stories are in the book <em><strong>The Story of The Romans Ⅶ Notorious Emperors</strong></em>  which I finished reading today!</p>
            <p>Actually, I think Tiberius and Claudius are not so bad, it’s just Tiberius is too cold to people and Claudius is too cowardly, so people thought they are bad. This also shows that it’s not easy being an emperor.</p>
            <p>I discovered something as well——in history, many emperors who has talent in art don’t have talent in ruling an empire, like Nero who was good at music, and Li Yu in China who was good at writing poems.</p>

    <p>I was furious today， because I planned today’s blog to be a text about the argue between my father and my grandmother, but they both forbid me to post it on my website even I had written it down, it really made me angry. Because it’s the only interesting or important thing happened today, if I can’t post it I can’t think of anything else to write about! So in the end I decided just to write about this thing itself.</p>

      <p>Today I found out an interesting thing.</p>
      <p>I was playing around on YouTube when I discovered a “360° Video” part I was very curious about it, so I secretly watched one of the videos and found it really wonderful and magical!</p>
      <p>It’s like watching a VR movie! You can see things in all directions by dragging on the screen, and fortunately, I also found out that my father had downloaded some videos on the computer they really glut my eyes!</p>

     <p>It’s a sad history of the empire, enemies watch for the proper moment for war, compatriots battle in a melee.</p>
     <p>The empire is going to perish, many emperors died of murder and war.</p>
     <p>In the series of ordeals, will the empire reborn or will it be ruined and lost it’s glory?</p>
     <p>This piece of history is in the book The Story of the Romans Ⅷ Crisis and Overcome which I finished reading today!</p>
     <p>From the book, I learned that “Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme”.  Vitellius tried to kill all the soldiers who swore their loyalty to the previous emperor——Otho, to prevent them from overthrowing him, but that only made his life shorter. And the emperor Vespasianus who made lows to forbid others overthrown an emperor by prosecuting him to make the emperors after him (his sons) safer, but that led to the assassination of Domitianus, because there is no other ways of getting rid of him.</p>

     <p>Today I read the short story <strong><em>The Two Fishermen</em></strong> written by Maupassant.</p>
     <p>It tells the story of two fishermen friends went fishing when their city is besieged by enemies in a war, they have the password in their army, and they are very careful, but they are still caught by the enemy.</p>
     <p>From the story, I learned that we mustn’t take unnecessary risks, like the two fishermen, but I also see courage and loyalty in their hearts, because they didn’t tell the passwords to the enemy, which made them die in the end.</p>

     <p>the video caused me to rethink deeply about the world around us, because it is proved that our basic senses, our elementary ways to explore the world can mislead us, so are the world just a mislead or a “delicate fiction”? If it is, what is the real world like? If it isn’t, how can we prove it?</P>
     <p>But of course, these questions have no answers, though I will still be glad to hear your thoughts!</P>

    <p>I tested my vocabulary today!</p> 
    <p>I was really excited to see my reading vocabulary reached 6000 and my listening vocabulary reached 7000!</p>
    <p>I was worried before the test, but unfortunately the worry comes true. When I’m testing my listening vocabulary, the phone suddenly stuck in a page and won’t let me go on testing when I’m almost finished! So I have to test again, but "<em>a loss may turn out to be a gain, misfortune may be an actual luck</em>"，maybe I’ve done worse in the unfinished one than the one I finished!  Who knows!</p>

   <p>Today I thought about an interesting question, water is important to us, we can't live without them, but gold is more expensive than water, even we can't eat or drink it!</p>
   <h3><strong><em>But WHY is it❓❓❓</em></strong></h3>
   <p>Is it just because of the gold is rare, or in some conditions water can be more expensive than gold? There are many hypothesis of mine, but I'd like to hear your thoughts!</p>

    <p>Today I read an article about the difference between pieces knowledge and a knowledge system, knowledges is only useful to us when we put them together and we line them up in a system, learning pieces of knowledge is just a waste of time. Like I know a piece of knowledge in physic and I also know a piece of knowledge in biology or in chemistry but they are just tiny pieces, learning these pieces can’t make me become a physicist or a chemist. And like which superstar like what colors, these are also knowledges but learning them is a waste of time, they have no use to me!</p>
    <p>“Knowledge is power”, this sentence is actually not very correct, it should be “Systems of knowledge is power”. Many knowledges on the Internet nowadays have been ripped apart, they are pieces, they can only make you win a quick quiz but they can’t let you pass a real exam.</p>
    <p>So we must choose what things do we learn carefully, because our time is limited, we mustn’t waste them.</p>

    <p>I’m learning about chemistry and  astronomy these days and today I thought about a question of how can the protons in the nucleus bond together so tightly? It is widely known that protons are positive electrically charged and electrons are negative electrically charged so they attract each other, but how can the two or more same positive charged protons bonded so tightly together in the nucleus? There must be another more powerful force acting between them. But what force can be stronger than electromagnetic force? I and my farther discussed about this but we can’t work that out, and I didn’t find any good answers on the Internet so if you have any idea, please let me know.</p>

    <p>Today I had a table tennis ball competition with my dad, he won in the end even though l also beat him in some rounds. It really made me feel that my techniques in table tennis needs to be improved. Every time when I strike, the ball will fly too far which made me timid and didn’t dare to strike when there is a chance.</p>
    <p>I am also moving too slow, this really made me lost many scores. I think these are my main problems at table tennis. I will fix them as soon as I can and of course, I’ll keep learning and keep practicing table tennis, maybe some time in the future, I will be able to defeat my dad!</p>

     <p>Today my dad told me about the Zhenbao Island incident. I was excited and interested because I like histories, wars and politics between countries all the time.</p>
     <p>We discussed about the incident and searched it on the Internet, we saw different opinions of the incident from the perspective of different countries. China thought the incident was a self-defense counterattack but Russia thought it’s us who cunningly attacked them first, America on the other hand, thought this incident made it gain profit while it just looks on the battle.</p>
     <p>All in all, I think I can learn a lot from the game between countries and especially powerful and big countries. Because between these countries, every step of action is done with lots of schemes in it, and these schemes are really interesting to consider about.</p>

     <p>I watched lots of videos about sending astronauts to Mars these days, it’s an attractive idea to me because of the mysteries and imaginations about Mars. There are many science fiction books about aliens from Mars and their invasion to Earth.</p>
     <p>As I’m a science fiction fan, I really want to find out whether there are or there were life on Mars. But landing, walking or living on Mars is really different from the moon or the Earth, it’s very difficult, many problems need to be solved and solving them is our mission, because we are the younger generation, we are the future of humanity. Maybe the dream of sending humans to Mars can come true with our hard work when we grow up!</p>

     <p>There are so many coincidences these days, I was learning cosmology and astronomy on Khan Academy and found videos on the internet and TV programs about the universe the planets and galaxies, and today I watched another live lecture of a scientist in Beijing university, about the solar system. I was not only enthusiastic about the idea that there are many “solar system”s just like ours in the universe (the idea was told in the lecture), but also curious about life on other planets.</p>
     <p>The universe is expanding just like our enriching  knowledge we can never explore the universe completely just like we can’t learn all the knowledges. But the process of exploring, discovering and learning it self is a kind of enjoyment.</p>

     <p>Today I read an article about the America’s economy development. From the article I found out that countries would do anything: war, tricks, even lies to gain profit. I also saw that it’s not easy being a president or the leader of a country because they have to have good strategy layouts, they have to be wise and most importantly, they also have to be a half scientist, half economist and half strategist.</p>
     <p>Like my father said, “Statesmen are careful with every word they say and their words usually don’t just have one meaning, you should never just comprehend their words literally.” it’s obviously hard to do that all the time but “with great power, comes great responsibility”, if you want the power, you have to undertake the responsibility first.</p>

       <p>However, because it’s a windy day, when I went out to play badminton with my friends, we are not able to play it normally. When I am at the tailwind side, The ball will always fly too far and my opponent can’t even strike the ball! It’s quite a fun playing it in a windy weather!</p>

       <p>Today my mother compelled me to play my clarinet and I must obey because she promised that if I do as she said this week, she will buy <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em> movie for me, which I wanted the most. I hope she will fulfill her promise this time because last time when she promised to buy the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> movie for me, she reneged her words.</p>

       <p>Today my father brought back a noodle-making machine, it looks quite useful and I’d like to try it out some days later.</p>
       <p>Moreover, I watched a part of <em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em> movie which my father downloaded yesterday, it was engaging, fascinating, interesting and attractive, I found out that I am not able to pause the movie because it’s so wonderful! I just want to watch it on and on, but of course, it’s not allowed, I was dragged away from the computer by my father because it was quite late in the night and I must go to bed. It was really quite disappointing being dragged away at the climax of a movie.</p>

I think the movie was fantastic, there are beautiful scenes and gripping plots, it’s really a good movie, I hope you’ll enjoy it! Moreover, I will also soon be finishing reading the original book of this movie, it’s even more exciting than the movie.</p>

       <p>Today I watched a video about The Top 10 Unbelievable Badminton Shots! Some of them are really unbelievable: a player's racket slips out of his hand but he quickly picked it up to continue to play and finally won the round! I was always imagining about striking the ball and let it stop on top of the net precisely these days and in the video, there was this condition,  the ball just stops in the middle and won't fall to any side! I was quite curious about how will the referee adjudge this.</p>

      <p>Today I watched several videos about Sir Francis Drake and his great voyages across the sea. I was learning about Sir Francis Drake in my English class and my parents liked to expand the things I’m learning in class, so they found videos about him and I really benefited a lot from them. In class and in the videos, I was told  that Drake is adventurous and courageous, he have done heroic things, but they are all avoiding the fact that Drake sold slaves and marauded ships from other countries, he was a bad pirate who captures and sells slaves! How can he be a hero? Moreover, Drake was said as an explorer, but his circumnavigate around the globe was just because of the way to get back to England was blocked by the Spanish fleet so he have to go the other way, that is to circumnavigate the globe, that’s not an epic voyage, it’s a fugitive running for his life!</p>

      <p>Today my father finally agreed to let me watch the second movie of The Lord of the Rings series—— The Two Towers! I was dreaming of watching it since I’ve watched the first one because it was so attractive, you just can’t stop watching it! It’s really enjoying to drink milk while watching a good movie, I had a wonderful time watching it! Moreover, we also made some dumplings with the noodle-making machine I mentioned before, it’s more efficient and mechanized now, you can easily make pastries out of the noodle-making machine, then you only have to press the mould on them and add the fillings! How simple!</p>

     <p>Today at lunchtime, I and my father were invited to a banquet, I was very happy because the foods are tasty and I made a friend at the table, we discussed about histories and were both pleased and impressed.</p>
     <p>After the banquet, he invited me to go and climb the Zhao Mu mountain with him, I asked my father about this and he agreed to come with us and I got into their car, soon we arrive at their home, and I can’t see my father’s car following behind, so I asked them about this but they said that my father drove home and haven’t followed their car, then they led me to the home, my friend changed clothes and we played chess for a while.</p>
     <p>Afterwards we got in the car and they drove towards the Zhao Mu mountain, on the way, we were told that there are too many visitors on the mountain, so they changed the plan and brought us to an exercising center and there was a personal coach waiting for us, we run around the playground in circles, and was very tired when we get back again. By the way, my friend’s parents were very rich they live in a big house which is unexpected to me, I was feeling restricted and unhappy and the dinner was distasteful. I was finally back at home after having dinner, it was really an unpleasant afternoon I was very upset, I went back home signing tiredly.</p>

However, Just then, my mother phoned me and asked me to compress some files on the computer and send them to her, moreover, she taught me how to compress a file and I noticed an “encryption” button when I’m compressing the files! I was excited and put what I have learned into practice , soon I succeed encrypting my novel!</p>

After lunch, my grandfather took me to take a walk in the park near their house, The park was very beautiful in spring, there were many flowers and green grasses. The park had changed a lot, I haven’t went there for a year and now new lakes and pavilions were built, walking in these beautiful new buildings, I felt a strong poetic inspiration, now I am planning to write a poem about the wonderful scenes in the park and my feelings tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Today I watched a video broadcasted by BBC about “Du Fu, the greatest poet in China history”! I liked to watch videos about China’s history from the point of view of foreigners all the time, this time also but it was more interesting than the other videos because there are the poems of Du Fu translated to English and read in the tone of Shakespeare’s plays! I think the translation is quite good and had a special charm. I have read lots of Chinese poems written by Du Fu, I know his style very well and I can still feel it in the English translation, his worry about the fall of the dynasty, his compassion on the poor and his indignation of the wickedness. All these characteristics are respectable and honorable.</p>
