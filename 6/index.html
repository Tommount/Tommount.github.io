       <p>I went out to play with my friends this afternoon， we were very happy and excited,  the plan was to play hide and seek in the Sky-Maze,  but when we actually got there, we found out that  the way was one sided! It was very unfortunate,  isn't it?
 by the way, today was Mother's Day, but I did nothing for her, I felt really sorry.</p>

       <p>Today I finished reading the book The Black Flame in just two days! Our teacher introduced this book to us, she said it was really good so I bought it, it’s not a thick book and I read it very quickly. The plots in the book are quite attractive, but I don’t think the story has a proper ending, This made me a bit confused and frustrated. By the way, I was tired and very busy today so this post might be a bit short.</p>

       <p>I was quite worried today, because is a new policy says that to graduate from a primary school and get into the secondary school it’s going to be in the form of draw or lottery, last year, however, it was still in the form of taking exams, and my performance in the exam made the best secondary school in my city agreed to enroll me! Now I’m fearing to lose this “invitation” to the best school!</p>

       <p>Today I finished reading the book The Heaven Sword and the Dragon Sabre Part 1 by Jing Yong. I like it very much because the plots are attractive and exciting, but mostly because of the powerful kung fu in it! My interest in Tai Ji is growing these days because of this, I can’t wait to be real kung fu master!</p>

     <p>Today I must sleep in my grandparents house because my father have to go very early in the morning and can’t send me to my school by his car, however, if I stay in my grandparents house tonight they can send me to my school on foot because it’s nearer to my school.

     <p>Today we had a debate! It was quite exciting but I was a little bit disappointed because my carefully-designed trap wasn’t used due to the little time we had and the discordance between my teammates, they always interrupt me when I’m going to lead our opponent team into my trap! In the end, however, we won the debate but I was quite upset.</p>

     <p>I was planning to have a relax today, but my teacher asked me to  carry some tables and chairs for the children in grade two, the sweat streamed down my head when I've done the work, and it made me have no time to enjoy the novel I brought in my schoolbag!  It's very unfortunate, isn't it?</p>

It's like the book had been sticked to my hand!  I'm so fascinated by it  that I felt lost and frustrated when I finished reading it today.</p>

     <p>  The homeworks are driving me mad today!  The homework for this weekend is to draw a timeline with pictures and words which shows the 6-year life in primary school,  since we are going to graduate now. it's quite a difficult task for me because I can't remember anything below grade 3! And I'm not quite good at drawing and designing, because of this, the timeline took me a whole day to complete! It made my mom angry and made me frustrated and tired.</p>

     <p>I was busy preparing for the celebration of children’s day tomorrow tonight. We went shopping for toast and sausages to bring to school tomorrow, they are quite difficult to choose though, so we spent lots of time in the supermarket which caused me being late for my English class. I was very happy and looking forward to the celebration tomorrow because it is said that there will be no homework for this weekend!</p>
