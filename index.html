            <div id="fp"><p>I finished reading the book <em><strong>Ordinary World</strong></em> today, it's a very thick book, has about 120 thousand words. I am so excited that I can't believe my eyes when I saw "the end" on the last page!</p>
        <p>The book is really interesting and attractive, it tells a story of some ordinary people in China at the age of 1975~1985 struggle to live, to become rich, to pursue dreams, and to fight against destiny.</p>
        <p>There are many characters in the book, some are respectable, some are detestable, some are ridiculous...... There are friendships, there are families, but there are also lies and self-concerns......everything in the book is actual and ordinary, just like the world itself.</p>

        <p>Today I finished reading the book <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans IV Caesar's Time(part 1)</strong></em>! It's the fourth book of <em><strong>The Story Of The Romans</strong></em> series.</p>
        <p>This book tells the story of Caesar from his birth to his attack to Rome. I worship Caesar very much, he is intelligent, he saw the disadvantage of the republic and he had a plan to change this; he is brave, he represented for the poor when the rich rules the republic, and he conquered Gaul undefeated!</p>

        <p>Today I write a poem, I want to share it with you.</p>
        <h3><em><strong>WATER</strong></em> </h3>
        <p>It takes life,</p>
        <p>It saves life.</p>
        <p>Its power can crush stone,</p>
        <p>Its clarity made things shone.</p>
        <p>It makes metal rusty.</p>
        <p>It can be large and crusty,</p>
        <p>It can be thin and fusty.</p>
        <p>It can change shape,</p>
        <p>It can change form.</p>
        <p>Cage and chains can not lock it up,</p>
        <p>It will easily escape.</p>
        <p>It summons storm.</p>
        <p>Its unpredictable when at norm.</p>
        <p>Its in the lake,</p>
        <p>Its in the river,</p>
        <p>Its water, Its everywhere! </p>

        <p>Today I finished learning <em><strong>HTML/CSS basics</em></strong> on Khan Academy.</p>
        <p>Thanks to it, I am able to build webpages from HTML and CSS and JaveScript (JS) to my webpage to make it better.</p>
        <p>I am planning to make this website a website all about me, not just my blog, but also have many other webpages about my games, my pictures etc. and a home page too. of course. But that’s very hard, I can’t do that now, yet I will do that one day in the future, and when the day comes, this website will be a great and complex one.</p>
